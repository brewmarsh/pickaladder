This document outlines the requirements for the pickaladder application.

## Functional Requirements

### User Management
*   **User Registration:** Users can create an account with a username, password, email address, and name.
*   **Email Verification:** Users must verify their email address before they can log in.
*   **User Login:** Users can log in with their username and password.
*   **Password Reset:** Users can reset their password if they forget it.
*   **Profile Updates:** Users can update their DUPR rating, password, and profile picture from their dashboard.

### Friend Management
*   **Find Friends:** Users can find other users to be friends with.
*   **Add Friends:** Users can add other users as friends.
*   **View Friends:** Users can view a list of their friends.
*   **Friends of Friends:** Users can see a list of "friends of friends" to get recommendations for new friends.
*   **View Friend Profile:** Users can view a friend's profile.

### Gameplay
*   **Match Creation:** Users can create matches with their friends.
*   **Match Viewing:** Users can view the details of a match, including an emphasized icon for the winner and each player's win/loss record. The player's icon and username are also clickable links to their profile page.
*   **Leaderboard:** The application has a leaderboard that shows the top 10 players by average score.
*   **Match History:** The user profile page displays a history of the user's matches. The winning score is bolded, and each match is a clickable link to the match details page.

### Admin Functionality
*   **Admin Panel:** Admin users have access to an admin panel.
*   **User Management:** Admins can delete users, promote users to admins, and reset user passwords.
*   **Database Management:** Admins can reset the database.
*   **Data Generation:** Admins can generate random users and matches for testing purposes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Architecture
*   **Monolithic Application:** The application is a monolithic web application built with Flask and PostgreSQL.
*   **Containerized:** The application is containerized with Docker and deployed with docker-compose.
*   **Blueprint-based:** The Flask application is organized using a blueprint-based structure.

### Database
*   **Database:** The application uses a PostgreSQL database.
*   **Connection Pooling:** The application uses a connection pool to manage database connections.
*   **Database Initialization:** The database is automatically initialized and migrated when the application starts.

### Security
*   **UUIDs:** User and match IDs are UUIDs to enhance privacy.
*   **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed using pbkdf2:sha256.

### User Interface
*   **Modern Design:** The application has a modern, clean, and responsive user interface with a Google-inspired design.
*   **Custom Styling:** The application uses a custom stylesheet and does not depend on any external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.

### Code Quality
*   **Linting:** The project uses `ruff` for linting and code formatting.
*   **Testing:** The project has a basic test suite.

## Future Enhancements

### Usability Improvements
*   **Real-time Updates:** The application currently requires a page reload to see updates. Implementing real-time updates using WebSockets would provide a much better user experience. For example, the leaderboard could update in real-time as matches are completed.
*   **Improved User Profiles:** User profiles could be enhanced to include more information, such as a user's match history, win/loss record, and a short bio.
*   **Friend Request Notifications:** When a user receives a friend request, they should receive a notification. This could be an in-app notification or an email.
*   **Match Confirmation:** When a match is recorded, both players should be required to confirm the score. This would help prevent disputes and ensure the accuracy of match results.
*   **Dark Mode:** The database schema includes a `dark_mode` column, but it does not seem to be fully implemented in the frontend. This feature should be completed.

### New User Features
*   **Match Scheduling:** Users should be able to schedule matches with other players. This would involve selecting a date, time, and location for the match.
*   **Double Matches:** The current application only supports singles matches. Adding support for doubles matches would be a valuable feature for many players.
*   **Player Statistics:** Users should be able to view detailed statistics about their own play, such as their win/loss record against specific opponents, their performance over time, and other metrics.
*   **Find a Partner:** A feature that allows users to find other players of a similar skill level to play with would be a great addition.
*   **Social Sharing:** Users should be able to share their match results and other achievements on social media.
*   **Match Location:** Users should be able to optionally record the location of a match. This could be a simple text field or integrated with a mapping service. This would be useful for tracking where matches are played and for facilities to see which courts are being used.

### Manager Features
*   **Tournament Brackets:** The application should support the creation and management of tournament brackets. This would include single-elimination, double-elimination, and round-robin formats.
*   **Facility Management:** Managers should be able to manage facility information, such as court availability and hours of operation.
*   **Event Registration:** The application should allow users to register for events and tournaments. This would include collecting registration fees and managing participant lists.
*   **Announcements:** Managers should be able to send announcements to all participants in an event or to all users of the application.
*   **Reporting:** The application should provide detailed reports on event participation, match results, and other key metrics. This would be useful for analyzing the success of events and for planning future ones.

### Security
*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all user-supplied data.
*   **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies.
*   **Session Management:** Implement secure session management practices.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

### Quality
*   **Type Checking:** Add static type checking with `mypy`.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand the test suite to include integration and end-to-end tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** Measure code coverage to identify untested parts of the codebase.

### Documentation
*   **API Documentation:** Generate API documentation.
*   **User Guide:** Create a comprehensive user guide.

### CI/CD
*   **Automated Deployments:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Use a tool like Terraform to manage infrastructure as code.

### Configuration
*   **Configuration File:** Use a configuration file instead of environment variables for all settings.
*   **Logging:** Implement a more robust and configurable logging system.

### Other Features
*   **Multiple Ladder Rankings:** Add support for multiple ladder ranking systems.
*   **Customizable Branding:** Allow admins to customize the branding of the admin page.
