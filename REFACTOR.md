# Refactoring Opportunities

This document outlines potential refactoring opportunities to improve the efficiency and scalability of the pickaladder application.

## 1. Database Optimization

The current implementation uses direct `psycopg2` calls for database interaction. While this works for a small application, it can lead to performance issues and maintainability problems as the application grows.

*   **Introduce an ORM:** Using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like SQLAlchemy would provide a more robust and maintainable way to interact with the database. An ORM can help prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, simplify queries, and improve code readability.
*   **Connection Pooling:** The application already uses a simple connection pool, which is good. However, for a high-traffic application, it might be beneficial to switch to a more advanced connection pooling solution like PgBouncer.
*   **Optimize Queries:** The `inject_user` context processor runs a query to fetch user data on every request. This could be optimized by caching user data in the session or using a more efficient caching mechanism like Redis.

## 2. Caching

The application does not currently use any caching. Implementing a caching layer could significantly improve performance, especially for frequently accessed data.

*   **Cache User Data:** As mentioned above, caching user data would reduce the number of database queries.
*   **Cache Leaderboard Data:** The leaderboard is likely to be a frequently accessed page. Caching the leaderboard data would reduce the load on the database and improve response times.
*   **Use a Caching Backend:** Implementing a caching solution like Redis or Memcached would provide a centralized caching layer that can be used throughout the application.

## 3. Asynchronous Tasks

Some tasks, like sending emails, can be time-consuming and block the request-response cycle. These tasks should be handled asynchronously.

*   **Use a Task Queue:** A task queue like Celery could be used to handle long-running tasks in the background. This would improve the user experience by reducing response times for requests that trigger these tasks.

## 4. Static Asset Management

The application currently stores profile pictures directly in the database as `BYTEA` data. This is inefficient and can lead to performance problems.

*   **Store Files on the Filesystem:** Profile pictures should be stored on the filesystem, and only the path to the file should be stored in the database.
*   **Use a CDN:** For a large-scale application, using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets like profile pictures would significantly improve performance.

## 5. Frontend Assets

The `frontend` directory contains a boilerplate React application that is not currently used. The application is a traditional server-side rendered Flask application.

*   **Remove Unused Frontend:** The unused React frontend should be removed to avoid confusion and reduce the size of the codebase.
*   **Modernize Frontend:** If a more interactive frontend is desired, the application could be migrated to a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js. This would involve creating a separate frontend application that communicates with the Flask backend via a REST API. This would also allow for a more modern and responsive user interface.
