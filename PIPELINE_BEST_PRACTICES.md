# Pipeline Best Practices Guide

This document outlines the best practices for creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines. The goal is to create a standardized, efficient, and secure process that can be shared and reused across multiple repositories.

## 1. Core Principles

Our CI/CD setup is built on the following principles:

*   **Speed:** Pipelines should be fast to provide quick feedback to developers.
*   **Security:** Pipelines should include automated security checks to catch vulnerabilities early.
*   **Clarity:** Workflows should be easy to read, understand, and maintain.
*   **Consistency:** The CI process should be consistent across different branches and repositories.

## 2. Workflow Structure

We use two primary CI workflows to ensure code quality and stability:

*   `main-ci.yml`: This workflow runs on pull requests to the `main` branch. It performs a comprehensive set of checks, including linting, formatting, security analysis, type checking, and running the full test suite.
*   `beta-ci.yml`: This workflow runs on pull requests to the `beta` branch. It mirrors the `main-ci.yml` workflow to ensure that the `beta` branch is always stable and ready for release.

This two-branch system allows us to test new features and bug fixes in an isolated `beta` environment before merging them into the `main` branch.

## 3. Tooling

Our pipelines use a modern, efficient toolchain to ensure code quality and security:

*   **`ruff`:** An all-in-one Python linter and formatter that is significantly faster than traditional tools like `flake8` and `pydocstyle`.
*   **`pip-audit`:** A tool for scanning Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **`bandit`:** A static analysis tool for finding common security issues in Python code.
*   **`mypy`:** A static type checker for Python.
*   **`coverage`:** A tool for measuring test coverage.

## 4. Caching

To optimize pipeline speed, we cache `pip` dependencies. This prevents the need to download and install the same packages on every run, significantly reducing build times.

## 5. Versioning

We use a simple, automated versioning system. The `beta-version-update.yml` and `production-version-update.yml` workflows automatically create a `VERSION` file containing the commit SHA. This ensures that every build is uniquely identified and traceable.

## 6. Extensibility

These best practices can be adapted for other projects by following these guidelines:

*   **Start with the template:** Use the `main-ci.yml` and `beta-ci.yml` workflows as a starting point for new repositories.
*   **Customize for your needs:** Add or remove steps as needed to fit the specific requirements of your project. For example, you may need to add steps for building and publishing a package or deploying to a different environment.
*   **Keep it simple:** Avoid adding unnecessary complexity to your pipelines. The goal is to create a system that is easy to understand and maintain.
